# Student-Intervention-System
•	Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school using supervised learning algorithms for student intervention system. Analyzed the pros and cons of different supervised learning algorithms.
•	Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.
